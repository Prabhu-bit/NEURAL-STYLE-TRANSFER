INTERN ID : CT04DL919

DOMAIN : ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

#DESCRIPTION 

This project is a simple and elegant demonstration of Neural Style Transfer (NST) implemented using PyTorch and executed via Google Colab. It showcases how artificial intelligence can blend the content of one image with the artistic style of another to produce stunning, creative visuals.

The entire backend code runs in a Google Colab notebook, making it easy to experiment without needing local setup or a powerful GPU. The frontend is a fully responsive website built using Tailwind CSS, acting as a clean interface for exploring the project, viewing demos, and accessing Colab and GitHub.

💡 Project Overview
Neural Style Transfer is a technique that uses deep neural networks to apply the visual appearance of one image (style) to the structure of another (content). This project uses a pre-trained VGG-19 model to extract content and style representations from images and optimizes a target image to match both.

This implementation was developed as part of the CodTech AI Internship, and focuses on usability, simplicity, and clarity of presentation.

🔗 Key Components
🎯 Google Colab Notebook
All code runs in an interactive Colab notebook — no setup needed. Users can upload their own content and style images, execute cells, and download the output.

🌐 Frontend Website
A modern, visually appealing website built to showcase:

Overview of NST

How the model works

Demo gallery with before/after images

Buttons to launch Colab and view source on GitHub

💻 GitHub Repository
Contains all source code, notebook, images, and website files in one place.

📂 How to Use
Click the "Open in Colab" button on the website or below:


Follow the steps in the notebook:

Upload your content image

Upload your style image

Run the cells to generate a stylized result

Download the output image



📷 Demo Gallery
Visit the website’s demo section to see how portraits, cityscapes, and natural scenes are transformed into artwork using styles from Van Gogh, Monet, Picasso, and more.

🛠 Tools Used
🧠 PyTorch (for NST)

🖼 PIL (for image processing)

💻 Google Colab (for execution)

🌐 HTML + Tailwind CSS (for frontend UI)
